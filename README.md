# FOCP-II-Project-Semester-II-
Semester-II - End Term Project for FOCP-II (Fundamentals of Computer Programming-II) 


## Problem Statement 
Blood Bank management System: The aim of the project is to retrieve, process and store information related to donors and patients. The system inputs the details of patients (name, age, disease, doctor, admitted date, blood group required) and details of donors (name, age, blood group, any disease). There is a menu which has following choices:
1. Adding record of patient
2. Adding record of donor
3. Search donor with existing blood group
4. Search patient with name
5. List of patients with blood group required and admitted date sorted in ascending order

Definition of Done:
1.	The donor is allotted to a patient only if both blood group matches. 
2.	Above choices have to be implemented using functions
3.	If the age of a donor is greater than 20, then only he is allowed to give blood otherwise display “invalid age”.
4.	While assigning donor to patient, retrieve the list of patients who require blood with particular group. If there are more than one patient, then the patient with least admitted date is allotted blood.



## Minimum Hardware Requirement

## Java Concepts Used
###### 1. Scanner Class
Scanner is a class in java.util package used for obtaining the input of the primitive types like int, double, etc. and strings. It is the easiest way to read input in a Java program, though not very efficient if you want an input method for scenarios where time is a constraint like in competitive programming.

###### 2. Exception Handling
Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved. Java Exception    Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

###### 3. File Handling
In Java, with the help of File Class, we can work with files. This File Class is inside the java.io package. The File class can be used by creating an object of the class and then specifying the name of the file.

###### 4. ArrayList
The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package.
The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you must create a new one). While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want.
